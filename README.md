## What if Hearts of Iron had a tool that let you reassign provinces between states without manual edits?

What if that tool didn't create files in your HOI4 user folder that crash your game?

Bye bye nudger!

This is a command for VS Code that allows you to assign and reassign provinces state-to-state for your Hearts of Iron 4 Mod.

## Features

Here's how to reassign provinces in HoI4:

1. Press CTRL + SHIFT + P.

2. Type hoi4.reassignProvinces and press Enter.

3. Enter the IDs of the provinces you want to reassign, separating each ID with a space.

4. Enter the ID of the state you want to assign the selected provinces to.

5. The specified provinces will be removed from their current states (if any) and added to the state you entered.

## Requirements

[This extension basically outmodes the nudger and you should use it.](https://github.com/herbix/hoi4modutilities/tree/master)
<br>HOI4, not really but I don't know what you'd use this for otherwise.

## Extension Settings


This extension contributes the following settings:

* hoi4ProvinceReassigner.statesDirectory

If for some reason you need to change this you can.

**Enjoy!**
